sometric 3D technical illustration. Very light grey background. Exact same soft green and muted grey monochrome palette. Flat surfaces with subtle grainy edge texture. Thin dark outline strokes defining all geometry. Minimalistic, clean, structured composition.  Camera framing: ultra-tight crop, zoomed-in framing. The illustration must fill 100% of the canvas edge-to-edge. No margins. No outer whitespace. No empty background areas. The outermost geometry must touch or nearly touch all four canvas edges. The bounding box of the artwork must align exactly with the canvas boundaries.  Scene: A boy sitting at a simple rectangular desk, back view, perfectly centered and scaled large. The desk width extends close to left and right canvas edges. The chair base extends close to the bottom edge. The top floating elements extend close to the top edge.  The boy is rendered in geometric, simplified mechanical style. No facial detail. Clean shapes only.  The laptop is open. From the laptop screen area, a circular central node labeled “MongoDB” floats slightly above the screen.  Around it, evenly spaced circular floating icons:  JSON document structure  Audio waveform symbol  Video play frame  Image/photo icon  Data blocks  File/document symbol  All floating elements are tightly arranged in a compact circular layout around MongoDB. The circle radius must be small and dense — no excessive spacing between icons.  All elements connected with thin straight connector lines and small circular node joints.  All connector nodes, joint circles, and line endpoints must be white or very light grey (#F0F0F0 or lighter). Never black. No dark node outlines.  Symmetrical alignment. Compact spacing. No loose composition.  No gradients. No dramatic lighting. No external shadows. Subtle depth using stacked isometric layers only. Minimal background. Technical UI precision.  The subject must occupy at least 95–100% of the canvas area.  no wide spacing , the visual should fit in to the image

# Prompt 2

Isometric 3D technical illustration of a MacBook-style laptop only. Very light grey background. Exact same soft green and muted grey monochrome palette. Flat surfaces with subtle grainy edge texture. Thin dark outline strokes defining all geometry. Minimalistic, clean, structured composition.  Camera framing: ultra-tight crop, zoomed-in framing. The laptop must fill 95–100% of the canvas edge-to-edge. No margins. No outer whitespace. No empty background areas. The outermost geometry must touch or nearly touch all four canvas edges. The bounding box of the laptop must align exactly with the canvas boundaries.  Laptop design: ultra-thin aluminum unibody form, sharp clean chamfered edges, flat minimal lid, wide centered trackpad, evenly spaced minimal keyboard grid, thin display bezel. Open at approximately 100–110 degrees in isometric perspective. No logo visible. No branding marks.  Screen is blank with a flat muted tone matching the palette. No UI elements unless specified.  No gradients. No dramatic lighting. No external shadows. Subtle depth created only using stacked isometric layers. Technical UI precision. Symmetrical alignment. Compact geometry. No decorative elements.  The laptop must feel engineered, geometric, and mechanically simplified — clean vector precision.
