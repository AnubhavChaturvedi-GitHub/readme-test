sometric 3D technical illustration. Very light grey background. Exact same soft green and muted grey monochrome palette. Flat surfaces with subtle grainy edge texture. Thin dark outline strokes defining all geometry. Minimalistic, clean, structured composition.  Camera framing: ultra-tight crop, zoomed-in framing. The illustration must fill 100% of the canvas edge-to-edge. No margins. No outer whitespace. No empty background areas. The outermost geometry must touch or nearly touch all four canvas edges. The bounding box of the artwork must align exactly with the canvas boundaries.  Scene: A boy sitting at a simple rectangular desk, back view, perfectly centered and scaled large. The desk width extends close to left and right canvas edges. The chair base extends close to the bottom edge. The top floating elements extend close to the top edge.  The boy is rendered in geometric, simplified mechanical style. No facial detail. Clean shapes only.  The laptop is open. From the laptop screen area, a circular central node labeled “MongoDB” floats slightly above the screen.  Around it, evenly spaced circular floating icons:  JSON document structure  Audio waveform symbol  Video play frame  Image/photo icon  Data blocks  File/document symbol  All floating elements are tightly arranged in a compact circular layout around MongoDB. The circle radius must be small and dense — no excessive spacing between icons.  All elements connected with thin straight connector lines and small circular node joints.  All connector nodes, joint circles, and line endpoints must be white or very light grey (#F0F0F0 or lighter). Never black. No dark node outlines.  Symmetrical alignment. Compact spacing. No loose composition.  No gradients. No dramatic lighting. No external shadows. Subtle depth using stacked isometric layers only. Minimal background. Technical UI precision.  The subject must occupy at least 95–100% of the canvas area.  no wide spacing , the visual should fit in to the image

Isometric CPU – Same Style Prompt  Isometric 3D technical illustration of a CPU processor chip only. Very light grey background. Exact same soft green and muted grey monochrome palette. Flat surfaces with subtle grainy edge texture. Thin dark outline strokes defining all geometry. Minimalistic, clean, structured composition.  Camera framing: ultra-tight crop, zoomed-in framing. The CPU must fill 95–100% of the canvas edge-to-edge. No margins. No outer whitespace. No empty background areas. The outermost geometry must touch or nearly touch all four canvas edges. The bounding box of the CPU must align exactly with the canvas boundaries.  Design: Square processor chip in isometric perspective. Layered stacked structure to show subtle depth. Slight raised central core plate on top surface. Clean beveled edges. Evenly spaced micro contact pins or connector pads along all four sides (geometric simplified style, not overly detailed). Perfect symmetry.  Optional subtle engraved label on top center: “CPU” in clean thin technical font.  Pins/pads rendered as small uniform rectangular or square blocks. All connectors and small node details must be white or very light grey (#F0F0F0 or lighter). Never black.  No gradients. No dramatic lighting. No external shadows. Subtle depth using stacked isometric layers only. Technical UI precision. Compact geometry. No decorative elements.  The processor must feel engineered, mechanical, and precision-built. Clean vector accuracy.

Isometric Human–Robot Interaction – Bit 3D Solid Style  Isometric 3D technical illustration. Very light grey background. Exact same soft green and muted grey monochrome palette. Flat matte surfaces with subtle grainy edge texture. Thin dark outline strokes defining all geometry. Minimalistic, clean, structured composition.  Character style: Solid Bit-3D forms. Smooth rounded geometric shapes. Soft edges but not glossy. No transparency. No crystal effect. No reflections. No glass. Matte finish only. Slightly friendly proportions inspired by animated 3D style, but simplified and mechanical. No facial details. No realistic anatomy.  Camera framing: ultra-tight crop, zoomed-in framing. Composition must fill 95–100% of the canvas edge-to-edge. No margins. No outer whitespace. No empty background areas. The outermost geometry must nearly touch all four canvas edges.  Scene: One geometric human figure standing and facing a robot in isometric perspective. Both scaled large and centered.  Human: Rounded block-style head, cylindrical limbs, softened rectangular torso. Clean segmentation. Neutral standing posture with one arm slightly raised as if asking or explaining something.  Robot: Humanoid but mechanical. Rounded head with a simple horizontal visor line (no glowing eyes). Boxy torso. Cylindrical arms and legs. Subtle panel divisions to suggest engineered construction. Friendly but structured.  Between them: Two compact isometric speech bubbles.  Human bubble: “What is AI?”  Robot bubble: “AI is intelligence simulated by machines.”  Speech bubbles are simple rounded rectangles in isometric view. No connector lines. No nodes. No floating UI elements. No diagrams.  Symmetrical and compact layout. Tight spacing.
